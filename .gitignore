# == Backend (Python/FastAPI) Specific Files ==
# assuming your backend is located at `app/backend_api` or `app/backend`
# You might need to adjust the path if your backend is in a different location.

# Python virtual environment (if created inside the project)
/backend/venv/              # If your backend is in `app/backend/venv`
/backend_api/venv/          # If your backend is in `app/backend_api/venv`
.venv/                      # Common virtual environment name

# Python compiled files
__pycache__/

# Database files (FastAPI/SQLAlchemy)
*.db                      # e.g., diary.db (this will ignore any .db file in your project root, be careful if you have other dbs you want to track)
!app/backend_api/app/diary.db  # Example: UNCOMMENT AND ADJUST if you want to track a specific database file
# OR: If your FastAPI database file is always named `diary.db` and you want to track it only there:
#!backend/app/diary.db # If your backend is `app/backend/` as per your latest structure
#!backend_api/app/diary.db # If your backend is `app/backend_api/app/` as per recommended structure

# Log files for Python
